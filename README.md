# Snake Game

## Overview

This project is aimed at creating a simple Snake game using Python. The game will be developed following the classic Snake gameplay mechanics, where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body.

## Project Structure

- **Documentation**: Contains project-related documents such as design specifications, user manuals, etc.
- **Source Code**: Holds all the Python source code files for the game.
- **Tests**: Includes test scripts and files for testing the game functionality.

## Getting Started

To run the Snake game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the source code directory: `cd sourcecode`
